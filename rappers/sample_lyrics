Don\u2019t crease 'em! Just leave 'em in that box!\"\nStrangled by these laces, laces I can barely talk\nThat's my air bubble and I'm lost, if it pops\nWe are what we wear, we wear what we are\nBut see I look inside the mirror and think Phil Knight tricked us all\nWill I stand for change, or stay in my box?\nThese Nikes help me define me\nBut I'm trying to take mine off\n\n[Hook: Children Choir]\nI wanna fly, can you take me far away?\nGive me a star to reach for\nTell me what it takes\nAnd I'll go so high, I'll go so high\nMy feet won't touch the ground\nJust stitch my wings and pull the strings\nI bought these dreams that all fall down\n\n[Outro: Macklemore]\nThey started out with what I wear to school\nThat first day\nLike these are what make you cool\nAnd this pair, this would be my parachute\nSo much more than just a pair of shoes\nNah, this is what I am\nWhat I wore, this is the source of my youth\nThis dream that they sold to you\nFor a hundred dollars and some change\nConsumption is in the veins\nAnd now I see it's just another pair of shoes\n\n",

County Coroner\u2019s office ruled the rapper's death accidental...\"\n\"And attributed it to a combination of...\"\n\"Apnea?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"...and syrup, and we know that syrup on the streets usually has codeine?\"\n\"Absolutely, we have a problem now with the cough syrup epidemic...\"\n\n[Verse 1]\nHe rolled up, asked him what he was sipping on\nHe said lean, you want to hit it, dawg?\nThat's the same stuff Weezy's sipping huh\nAnd tons of other rappers that be spitting hard\nYup, he had five up on\nWhen he passed him that Styrofoam\nThe Easter pink, heard it in a rhyme before\nFinally got to see what all the hype was on\nAnd then he took a sip, sitting in the Lincoln\nThinking he was pimping as he listened to the system\nLittle did he know that it was just as addictive as base\nNot the kind of hit from the kick drum\nHot box, let the bass bump\nTake it to the face, gulp\nMonths later the use went up\nEvery blunt was accompanied by the pink stuff\nBut goddam, he loved that feeling\nPurple rain coated in the throat, just so healing\nMedicine alleviate the sickness\nLiquid affix and it comes with a cost\nWake up, cold sweat, scratching, itching\nTrying to escape the skin that barely fit him\nGone, get another bottle just to get a couple swallows\nHeaded towards the bottom couldn't get off it\nDidn't even think he had a problem\nThough he couldn't sleep without getting nauseous\nRoom spinning\nThinking he might of sipped just a little bit too much of that cough syrup\nHis eyelids closed shut\nSat back in the chair clutching that cup\nGirlfriend came and a couple hours later\nSaid his name, shook him but he never got up\n\nHe never got up, he never got up\nWe live on the cusp of death thinking that it won't be us\nIt won't be us, it won't be us, it won't be us\nNah, it won't be us\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow he just wanted to act like them\nHe just wanted to rap like him\nUs as rappers underestimate the power and the effects that we have on these kids\nBlunt passed, ash in a tin\nPack being pushed, harassed by the Feds\nThe fact of it is most people that rap like this\nTalking about some shit they haven't lived\nSurprise, you know the drill\nTrapped in a box, declining record sales\nFollow the formula: violence, drugs, and sex sells\nSo we try to sound like someone else\nThis is not Californication\nThere's no way to glorify this pavement\nSyrup, Percocet, and an eighth a day\nWill leave you broke, depressed, and emotionally vacant\nDespite how Lil Wayne lives\nIt's not conducive to being creative\nAnd I know cause he's my favorite\nAnd I know cause I was off that same mix\nRationalize the shit that I'd try after I listen to Dedication\nBut he's an alien\nI'd sip that shit\nPass out or play PlayStation\nMonths later I'm in the same place\nNo music made, feeling like a failure\nAnd trust me it's not dope to be twenty-five\nAnd move back to your parent's basement\nI've seen my people's dreams die\nI've seen what they can be denied\nAnd \"Weed's not a drug,\" that's denial\nGroundhog Day, life repeat each time\nI've seen Oxycontin take three lives\nI grew up with them\nWe used to chief dimes\nI've seen cocaine bring out the demons inside\nCheating and lying\nFriendship cease, no peace in the mind\nStealing and taking anything to fix the pieces inside\nBroken, hopeless, headed nowhere\nOnly motivation for what the dealer's supplying\nThat rush, that drug, that dope\nThose pills, that crumb, that roach\nThinking I would never do that, not that drug\nAnd growing up nobody ever does\nUntil you're stuck\nLooking in the mirror like I can't believe what I've become\nSwore I was going to be someone\nAnd growing up everyone always does\nWe sell our dreams and our potential\nTo escape through that buzz\nJust keep me up, keep me up\nHollywood, here we come\n\n[Outro]\nYou can tend to, um, go a little too far with some of these things , they have very strong addictive qualities, pills and syrups and whatnot, so um\u2026\n(Is it changing the music?)\nUm, I can only speak for myself personally, you know what I'm saying? Um, we had been taking down, toning down the content of certain things in the music lately. My new album, of course, probably won't have any references to cough syrup in it, but, uh, it's a little bit more than the music. I think it's gonna start affecting the personal lives of a lot of artists and people...\n\n",

Like, this is the generation to be offended by everything. \u2014 'Black Lives Matter' thing is a reason to take arms up over perceived slights. \u2014 I'm not prejudiced, I just... \u2014 99% of the time, across this country, the police are doing their job properly.\"\n\n[Verse 4]\nDamn, a lot of opinions, a lot of confusion, a lot of resentment\nSome of us scared, some of us defensive\nAnd most of us aren't even paying attention\nIt seems like we're more concerned with being called racist\nThan we actually are with racism\nI've heard that silences are action and God knows that I've been passive\nWhat if I actually read a article, actually had a dialogue\nActually looked at myself, actually got involved?\nIf I'm aware of my privilege and do nothing at all, I don't know\nHip-hop has always been political, yes\nIt's the reason why this music connects\nSo what the fuck has happened to my voice if I stay silent when black people are dying\nThen I'm trying to be politically correct?\nI can book a whole tour, sell out the tickets\nRap entrepreneur, built his own business\nIf I'm only in this for my own self-interest, not the culture that gave me a voice to begin with\nThen this isn't authentic, it is just a gimmick\nThe DIY underdog, so independent\nBut the one thing the American dream fails to mention\nIs I was many steps ahead to begin with\nMy skin matches the hero, likeness, the image\nAmerica feels safe with my music in their systems\nAnd it's suited me perfect, the role, I've fulfilled it\nAnd if I'm the hero, you know who gets cast as the villain\nWhite supremacy isn't just a white dude in Idaho\nWhite supremacy protects the privilege I hold\nWhite supremacy is the soil, the foundation, the cement and the flag that flies outside of my home\nWhite supremacy is our country's lineage, designed for us to be indifferent\nMy success is the product of the same system that let off Darren Wilson \u2013 guilty\nWe want to dress like, walk like, talk like, dance like, yet we just stand by\nWe take all we want from black culture, but will we show up for black lives?\nWe want to dress like, walk like, talk like, dance like, yet we just stand by\nWe take all we want from black culture, but will we show up for black lives?\n\n[Interlude 4: Various male and female voices]\n\"Black Lives Matter, to use an analogy, is like if... if there was a subdivision and a house was on fire. The fire department wouldn't show up and start putting water on all the houses because all houses matter.

Injustice anywhere is still injustice everywhere. \u2014 The best thing white people can do is talk to each other, having those very difficult, very painful conversations with your parents, with your family members. \u2014 I think one of the critical questions for white people in this society is, 'What are you willing to risk? What are you willing to sacrifice to create a more just society?'\"\n\n[Outro: Jamila Woods]\nYour silence is a luxury, hip-hop is not a luxury\nYour silence is a luxury, hip-hop is not a luxury\nYour silence is a luxury, hip-hop is not a luxury\nYour silence is a luxury, hip-hop is not a luxury\nWhat I got for me, it is for me\nWhat we made, we made to set us free\nWhat I got for me, it is for me\nWhat we made, we made to set us free\nWhat I got for me, it is for me\nWhat we made, we made to set us free\n\n[Click here to learn more about the making of \"White Privilege II\"]\n\n",

Doesn\u2019t really matter\nBefore long I\u2019m out of stuff to say and you smile and say, \u201cokay\u201d\nI don\u2019t know exactly what you mean by it, but it seems vaguely positive\nAnd I would leave in order not to spoil the moment\nBut there\u2019s nowhere to go because we\u2019re on a bus\nSo I pretend like I\u2019m asleep and before long, I really am\n\nI wake up, the bus isn\u2019t moving anymore\nThe domed lights that line the center aisle are all on\nI turn and you\u2019re not there\nThen again a lot of kids aren\u2019t in their seats anymore\nWe\u2019re parked at the pick-up point, which is in the parking lot of a Methodist church\nThe bus is half empty. You might be in your dad\u2019s car by now\nYour bags and things piled high in the trunk\nThe girls in the back of the bus are shrieking and laughing and taking their sweet time\nDisembarking as I swing my legs out into the aisle to get up off the bus\nJust as one of them reaches my row\nIt used to be our row, on our way off\nIt\u2019s Michelle, a girl who got suspended from third grade for a week\nAfter throwing rocks at my head\nAdolescence is doing her a ton of favors body-wise\nShe stops and looks down at me\nAnd her head is blasted from behind by the dome light, so I can\u2019t really see her face\nBut I can see her smile. And she says one word: \u201cdestiny\u201d\nThen her and the girls clogging the aisles behind her all laugh\nAnd then she turns and leads them off the bus\nI didn\u2019t know you were friends with them\n\nI find my dad in the parking lot. He drives me back to our house and camp is over\nSo is summer, even though there\u2019s two weeks until school starts\nThis isn\u2019t a story about how girls are evil or how love is bad\nThis is a story about how I learned something and I\u2019m not saying this thing is true or not\nI\u2019m just saying it\u2019s what I learned\nI told you something. It was just for you and you told everybody\nSo I learned cut out the middle man, make it all for everybody, always\nEverybody can\u2019t turn around and tell everybody, everybody already knows, I told them\nBut this means there isn\u2019t a place in my life for you or someone like you\nIs it sad? Sure. But it\u2019s a sadness I chose\nI wish I could say this was a story about how I got on the bus a boy\nAnd got off a man more cynical, hardened, and mature and shit\nBut that\u2019s not true. The truth is I got on the bus a boy. And I never got off the bus\nI still haven\u2019t...\n\n",
