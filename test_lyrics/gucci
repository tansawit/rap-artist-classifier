All my get money bitches stand up
All my trap niggas put your hands up
Gucci man I'm so rubber band up
And my car so clean it get a A+
Black Maybach with the red guts
I'm a get money bitches stand up
All my trap niggas put your hands up
Gucci man I'm so rubber band up
And my car so clean it get a A+
Black Maybach with the red guts
Yellow diamonds for you pretty red shluts
Selling weed man I bring some more bud
I'm a mud drinker bitch I drank mud

[Verse 1:]
Call it whip it and flip it and zip it and kush it
Calling your girl like grammy the pussy
I'm up in the kitchen and pick up a cookie
You're boyfriends a rookie that's why he a pussy
I'm fucking you bad I don't care who be looking
Stand on your porch and dare you to push me
Choppers on duty you don't have to touch me
I'm the boss and the boss gets all the glory
Changing the game I'm remaining the same
Buy new car I'm changing the pash
Changing the motor and changing the goods
Changing the gurgle's I'm pumping the pipe
A K A I'm cracking the seal those don't know
I'm tracking the train
Thinking about money we thinking the same
Fly's a bird and high's a plane
Might hit the club in a black tuxedo
Who hoes coming with his your man Galvino
Beat flash who should look like torpedo
Owe it to a nino, smoking on guido
Might have a man but he not like me no
Looking bald out to exterior
On a boat way cocaine locreo
He might get money but not like me no

[Chorus:]
All my get money bitches stand up
All my trap niggas put your hands up
Gucci man I'm so rubber band up
And my car so clean it get a A+
Black Maybach with the red guts
Yellow diamonds for you pretty red shluts
Selling weed man I bring some more bud
I'm a mud drinker bitch I drank mud

[Verse 2:]
Positiong myself and kushin my wealth
Hate no me that's best for your health
Efin my wounds than efin my shoes
Efin em show me, efin my bills
Niggas they envy, they just pretending
Glasses are empty and bitches are friendly
Asses are sexy and titties are pretty
Niggas are hold up and bitches are silly
Watches are quarter my chain is a milly
I can't lie all my hoes are so deadly
So I'm up on occasion than you think I was Diddi
Cases and cases and cases of blunts
Smoke like a hippie, drink like Britney
Walking in the club JB whole with me
Harder they try they can't get rid me
Looking like I'm dreaming someone pinch me
Two shooters right by, they're my henchmen
Gucci then came all same songs keep them
Left that hurt my people vibrating
And the paper in the hood keep on ringing
That lil chick that I met last weekend
Laughing and leaving I'm working on leaning
Swash or seed I could check on the season
Freshen' the club making bitch stop creeping

[Chorus:]
All my get money bitches stand up
All my trap niggas put your hands up
Gucci man I'm so rubber band up
And my car so clean it get a A+
Black Maybach with the red guts
Yellow diamonds for you pretty red shluts
Selling weed man I bring some more bud
I'm a mud drinker bitch I drank mud
